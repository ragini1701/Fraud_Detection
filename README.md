# Fraud_detection
**Credit Card Fraud Detection**
This repository contains code for a machine learning project that focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the finance industry to protect consumers and businesses from unauthorized transactions.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle. It contains a mixture of legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions, making it a suitable dataset for developing and evaluating fraud detection models.

**Project Overview**
The project follows these main steps:

**Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is cleaned, and any missing values are handled. Additionally, data is analyzed to understand its distribution and characteristics.

**Data Sampling:** To address class imbalance (fewer fraudulent transactions compared to legitimate ones), the dataset is resampled using a combination of oversampling and undersampling techniques.

**Model Training:** A logistic regression model is used for its simplicity and interpretability. The model is trained on the preprocessed and resampled data.

**Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores on both the training and test datasets. Other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score can also be considered.

**Usage**
**To run this project:**

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries, preferably in a virtual environment.
Run the Jupyter Notebook (credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb) to execute the code.
Results
The results of the model's performance are provided in the Jupyter Notebook. Users can analyze the accuracy and other relevant metrics to understand the effectiveness of the fraud detection model.
